### <a name="testing"></a>Testing
I didnt know what testing framework you use so I guessed karma. I just created a gulp task to do that. Due to the time constraints I havent tested as much as I would have liked. Hopefully this gives a basic overview of my capabilities.

    $ gulp test
<br />

### <a name="notes"></a>Notes
There was no time specified on the test so I only gave myself a few hours to complete the task.
There are obviously things missing like the footer. I didnt write any ajax posts. I think I have some examples on my github demonstrating that I can, If not I can supply them. I have only tested in chrome mac.
